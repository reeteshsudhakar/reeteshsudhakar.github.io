# Personal Website
I felt like this would be a great thing to build, so I put together this website off some examples that I found from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net). 

The page contains a small introduction, a contact form using [Formspree](formspree.io), and contains links to all my relevant social accounts for communication.
