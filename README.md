# Personal Website
I felt like this would be a great side project to build, so I put this website together to have a web presence. This was built based off of some examples that I found from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net). 

The page contains a small introduction, a contact form using [Formspree](https://formspree.io) integration, and contains links to all my relevant social accounts for communication and information. This repository also contains a CNAME redirect file towards my custom domain [reeteshsudhakar.com](https://reeteshsudhakar.com), which has SSL encryption. 

I've been recently tinkering with the website to understand more about design principles and front-end development using HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript. In doing so, the features and designs of the website have been changing more and more as of late. Enjoy!
